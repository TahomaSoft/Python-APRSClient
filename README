APRSClient.py

THE WHAT
A Python module for talking to APRS-IS servers.

THE WHAT (part deux)
As is probably blindingly obvious by looking at the code, I'm a Python novice.

Right now, all this module does is connect to an APRS-IS server, log in with a
supplied callsign, passcode and filter, and print received APRS packets to stdout.

THE WHY
I'm doing a lot of work with APRS at the moment, and I'm also learning Python. The
two go together well. Or really badly. Who knows? Nothing's caught fire... yet.

THE HOW
Use it like this:-

import APRSClient

server = 'vancouver.aprs2.net'
port = 14580

aprs = APRSClient
aprs.callsign = 'VE7QQQ'
aprs.passcode = '12345'
aprs.receive_filter = 'r/48.45/-123.4/200'

aprs.connect('vancouver.aprs2.net', 14580)

...and enjoy the stream of APRS packets from the Pacific Northwest.

Unittests:-
    cd unittests
    PYTHONPATH=.. python test-APRSParser.py
    PYTHONPATH=.. python test-APRSClient.py

THE WHAT NEXT
* Everything

Okay, being serious:-
* Parsing of position packets
* Decoding of compressed packets
* Sending packets
